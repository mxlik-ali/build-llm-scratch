# 🚀 Build Your Own LLM  

> _"I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand."_  
> — Confucius  

This repository is my personal **playground for building a Large Language Model (LLM)** from scratch, inspired by **Sebastian Raschka’s book _Build a Large Language Model From Scratch_**.  

The journey is not just about **training a model**, but about **understanding every layer**, every **token**, and every **attention head** that makes LLMs tick.  

---

## 📖 Motivation  
Modern LLMs like GPT, LLaMA, and Mistral are technological marvels—but they’re also black boxes to most people. My goal is to **demystify** them:  
- Understand how **tokenization** works (BPE, byte-level BPE, etc.).  
- Dive into **transformer architectures**.  
- Implement **training pipelines** step by step.  
- Learn **scaling laws** and optimization tricks.  

This repo documents my **hands-on journey**, mistakes included. Because failing forward is the best teacher.

## 🛠️ What’s Inside  
- 📂 **/notebooks** → Experiments and step-by-step builds.  
- 📂 **/src** → Clean implementations of core components (tokenizer, dataset, model).  
- 📂 **/data** → Sample datasets and preprocessing scripts.  
- 📝 **Logs** → Training logs, results, and reflections.

## 🖼️ Project Architecture (Placeholder)

Here’s where I’ll put a **visual overview** of the LLM I’m building:

## 🧩 Roadmap  

- [x] Implement character-level tokenizer  
- [x] Explore byte pair encoding (BPE)  
- [ ] Implement byte-level BPE tokenizer  
- [ ] Build transformer blocks step by step  
- [ ] Train on a toy dataset (e.g., Shakespeare)  
- [ ] Scale to a larger corpus  
- [ ] Add evaluation + sampling strategies  
- [ ] Experiment with fine-tuning

## 🔥 Vision  

By the end of this project, I want to:  
1. Have a **working GPT-style model** trained from scratch.  
2. Write detailed notes for each stage so others can learn alongside me.  
3. (Optional but exciting!) Train a **domain-specific mini-LLM**.

## 🙌 Acknowledgments  

Special thanks to:  
- **Sebastian Raschka** for his excellent book.  
- The **open-source AI community** for making research accessible.  

---

## 📌 Disclaimer  

This is a **learning project**. Don’t expect GPT-4 performance here 😅. The goal is clarity, not cutting-edge benchmarks.  

---

## 💡 Contribute / Feedback  

If you’ve built your own LLM, I’d love to learn from your approach!  
Pull requests, issues, or even **just ideas** are welcome.

### ✨ Closing Note  

This repo is a **journey log**—not just code, but curiosity in motion.  
Follow along as I peel back the layers of how machines learn to **read, reason, and write**.
